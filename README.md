## Abstract:
Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD) is an excitable decision-making model inspired by the spiking dynamics of neurons. S-NOD enables the design of agile decision-making that can rapidly switch between decision options in response to a changing environment. In S-NOD, decisions are represented by discrete opinion spikes that evolve in continuous time. Here, we extend previous analysis of S-NOD and explore its potential as a nonlinear controller with a tunable balance between robustness and responsiveness to input. We identify and provide necessary conditions for the bifurcation that determines the onset of periodic opinion spiking. We leverage this analysis to characterize the tunability of the input-output threshold for opinion spiking as a function of the model basal sensitivity and the tunable dependence of opinion spiking frequency on input magnitude above the threshold. We conclude with a discussion of S-NOD as a new neuromorphic control block and its extension to distributed spiking controllers.
